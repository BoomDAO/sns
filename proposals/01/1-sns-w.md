# Enable principal qf6cz-ciaaa-aaaag-abtsq-cai in SNS-W to initiate the generation of SNS for BOOM DAO.

The proposal offers BOOM DAO's products to the NNS to be turned into decentralized infrastructure, protocols, and dapps by the creation of an SNS to govern BOOM DAO's canisters.

## Who sent this proposal?

This proposal is sent by the BOOM DAO development team. BOOM DAO is an [**all-in-one web3 game development platform**](https://boomdao.xyz) running 100% on-chain on the Internet Computer. The project is presented in [**this whitepaper**](https://boomdao.notion.site/BOOM-DAO-WHITEPAPER-59bc2aa3380b4f86b01344da42157a24).

## What is the purpose of this proposal?

The BOOM DAO development team offers BOOM DAO's products and protocols to the NNS to be turned into a decentralized service by creation of a Service Nervous System (SNS) DAO to govern BOOM DAO. The products of BOOM DAO consist of the Game Launcher Platform, World Engine Protocol, World Template, Unity Template, and ICP.NET Library. The following BOOM DAO canisters will be directly controlled by the SNS:

- Game Launcher Frontend (awcae-maaaa-aaaam-abmyq-cai)
- Game Deployer (6rvbl-uqaaa-aaaal-ab24a-cai)
- World Deployer  (js5r2-paaaa-aaaap-abf7q-cai)
- NFT Deployer  (j474s-uqaaa-aaaap-abf6q-cai)
- ICRC Deployer (jv4xo-cyaaa-aaaap-abf7a-cai)
- World Hub (j362g-ziaaa-aaaap-abf6a-cai)
- User Nodes (Under control of World Hub canister)
- Payment Hub (5hr3g-hqaaa-aaaap-abbxa-cai)
- Staking Hub (jozll-yaaaa-aaaap-abf5q-cai)
- Unity Login Webpage Canister (7p3gx-jaaaa-aaaal-acbda-cai)

All of the other canisters are in turn controlled by one of the above listed canisters and would thus also be indirectly controlled by the SNS.

If this proposal is approved, the NNS mandates that the necessary steps to create a [**Service Nervous System (SNS) DAO**](https://internetcomputer.org/sns) to govern BOOM DAO are taken.

## What is the technical effect of this proposal?

Adoption of the proposal will enable and mandate installation of the required SNS canisters on the SNS subnet. These SNS canisters will be in a pre-decentralization-sale mode with limited capabilities and where tokens cannot be moved until the decentralization sale is completed. Technically, the proposal’s effect is that the cycles wallet with principal ID **qf6cz-ciaaa-aaaag-abtsq-cai**, which is controlled by BOOM DAO development team, will get the ability to make a call to the SNS wasm modules canister (SNS-W) to install SNS canisters. This privilege is a one-time occurrence, as it will be revoked after the call is made.

## What is this proposal not about / what will be decided in a second, future proposal?

This proposal does not yet include any concrete parameter choices for the BOOM DAO SNS. These parameters will be contained in an upcoming second NNS proposal to initiate the BOOM DAO decentralization sale and SNS DAO creation and thus can be checked and voted on at that time together with the conditions for the decentralization sale.
